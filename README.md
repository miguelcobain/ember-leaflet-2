# Ember Leaflet #
## Ember and Leaflet tight integration for rich map web application development. ##

Homepage: http://miguelcobain.github.io/ember-leaflet/

### Bindings ###
Essencially EmberLeaflet is a wrapper on top of Leaflet that exposes Ember properties.
This way, the leaflet map is updated when an Ember property changes and Ember properties are updated when the user interacts with the map

### Learn ###
This project is in its enfancy. You can learn by inspecting the code of the demo in [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/miguelcobain/ember-leaflet/tree/gh-pages) and/or of the [component](https://github.com/miguelcobain/ember-leaflet/blob/master/src/ember-leaflet.js) itself.
